- seem there's no way to export to png from console indicating the dimensions
- you can use mid_2_wav and mid_2_mp3 to get the audios
- open the midis in musescore, change the dimension in design->page settings
- save as .mscz
- export as png (even so the console doesn't work, export each png manually)
